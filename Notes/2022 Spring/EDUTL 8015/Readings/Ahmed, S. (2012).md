# On Being Included

Ahmed, S. (2012). On being included. Duke University Press.

## Introduction

- In the first few pages, I got a feel for the identity
  of the author. They appear to identify as non-white.
- The author describes a lot of cool ideas related to
  being critical. In fact, they name drop their own
  institution, Lancaster University. 
- The author also describes a lot of painful stories.
  The story that was particularly painful was the
  story of cops calling the author "aboriginal."
  Though, I also found the story about the institution
  using geography as a reason for not addressing diversity
  as very frustrating.
