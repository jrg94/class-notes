# On Being Included

Ahmed, S. (2012). On being included. Duke University Press.

## Introduction

- In the first few pages, I got a feel for the identity
  of the author. They appear to identify as non-white.
- The author describes a lot of cool ideas related to
  being critical. In fact, they name drop their own
  institution, Lancaster University. 
- The author also describes a lot of painful stories.
  The story that was particularly painful was the
  story of cops calling the author "aboriginal."
  Though, I also found the story about the institution
  using geography as a reason for not addressing diversity
  as very frustrating. 

## Chapter 1

- Use phenomenology to surface the hidden
- Appointing a diversity officer may be the beginning of the end
  for diversity
- Institutionalization = becoming background
- Institution = resistance
- If diversity is not habitual, it becomes **trouble**
- Persistence
- Identify people who can further the cause

### Institutional Whiteness

- Sara -> whitness in the name
- Trying not to stick out 
- "when people of color become professors then whiteness recedes" LOL

### Institutional Racism

- **Systemic** vs. Individual
- Institutions only receive blame for racism when framed as an individual
  - I see this with language around corporations (i.e., someone has to take the fall)
- Institutional racism shiffts blame away from individuals

### Thoughts

- This chapter is sooooo repetitive.
- Implicit! I could summarize the entire chapter with this word.
- I saw a lot of parallels between language around diversity
  and some of the efforts I've seen by leftists to push people
  toward leftism (though I think these groups have major overlap).
  Interesting to see language around systemic and individual
  used to talk about corporations (i.e., they can be both).
- One of the challenges I've always had with the systemic vs.
  individual framing is that systems are designed, implemented,
  and maintained by individuals. When you shift the framing to
  a system, it allows those individuals to escape justice. 

## Chapter 2: The Language of Diversity

- Metaphor of the brick wall
- Diversity (the term) is the corporatization of academia

### Official Diversity (pg 54)

- Diversity language is performative... used for marketing
- "Diversity" (the term) is not ubiquitous
- "Diversity" (the term) = aesthetics

### The Diversity Word (pg 60)

- People are sick of the work "equity"
- Shift from confrontation to collaboration
- "Diversity" is a positive term
- "Diversity" can be eaten?
  - Use of the Thai food exampl
- The duality of diversity as a happy word means it gets
  more folks at the table but it hides the reason for 
  actually doing the work

### Diversity Strategies (pg 73)

- Switching = switching languages
- Use data to convince

### Diversity in Conversation

- Diversity in mission statements but that's it
- Diversity has no agreed understanding like equity

### Thoughts

- I'm still having trouble reading this. It's very repetitive
  and not super accessible to folks not in the field (e.g.,
  very heavy on jargon). That said, I think there are some
  solid nuggets to take out of it. For example, the idea that
  "diversity" is a safe term to get people into the work but
  not a great term for doing the hard work is insightful.

## Chapter 3: Equality and Performance Culture

- We are good at race equality
- An efficiency model

### Documenting Diversity

- Documents become a "fetish"
- Documents authority can be deferred as they are derivative
- Consultation?
- Repackaging?
- The document is a paper trail

### Equality and Audit

- Diversity and equity are auditable
- Audits are good
  - Force universities into action
- Audits are bad
  - Create a culture around audits
- Audits pose risks to reputation

### Good Practice

- Excellence is empty of content

## Chapter 4: Commitment as a Non-performative

- "Hearts & Minds"

### Statements of Commitment

- These statements are opaque
- What are they doing?
- Non-performative
  - Practice that does not work
  - Words that do nothing?
  - Not bringing into effect
- Commitment is opaque
- Commitment may block action (already committed)
- Saying diversity is a way of not doing it

### Committees and Commitments

- Committees are conversations spaces
- Time is crucial
  - A pledge of future resources
