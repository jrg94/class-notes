## Chapter 2: The Space Between Listening and Storying

- Language matters!
- Listening matters!
  - A framework of listening means telling, retelling, and re-presenting 
    stories in nonlinear ways
- Questions
  - What does it mean to listen and engage listening as a framwork in literacy research?
  - In what ways do practices in listening converge with acts of storying/storytelling/
    authoring?
  - How might these acts and actions foster innovative processes for conducting
    critical research and PiH with young people?

### Vignettes in Stories and Storying

- Valerie and the author share a story about exchanging research ideas.
  This conversation leans into the idea of "listening"
- The author brings up the idea that research should be more than for
  a purpose of for people and rather **with** and **alongside** others.
- Ah, PiH has an explanation: Projects in Humanization
- Interactions are about depth

### A Theoretical Consideration: Listening and Projects in Humanization

- We need to listen to what young people are saying and think about why they are saying
  it.
- Listening is grounded in Bakhtin's "semiotic mediation"
- Three concepts: dialogiticality, utterance, and voice
- Dialogue is collaboritively constructed
- Listening is important because worldviews may not be opposing but rather diverse
- "it has to begin where people know each other's names"
- "ideological struggle" -- i love this term
- Trust is important when having ideological struggles
- **What is with the focus on young people?**
- Also, there is a heavy emphasis on **silence**
- Add another term to the toolbelt: democratic engagements (DE)
- The importance of divergent perspectives (ties to this idea of ideological struggle)

### Methodological Challenges: Listening to Ourselves, Interacting with Others

- Dialogic spiral: cocreating trust
  - The revealing of vulnerabilities and feelings
  - Must move back and forth (from speaker to listener)
  - Words without discourse have no meaning
  - Conversations should involve note taking?
- The author ties all of this back to doing research:
  We should be breaking down barriers between participant
  and researcher.

### Implications for Projects in Humanization

- "I don't know" -- retreating behind these phrases?

## Thoughts

- The reading itself is a bit deep for me. There is a lot of jargon that I 
  familiar with, but it made the reading somewhat hard to digest.
- That said, the key takeaways seems to be that listening, allowing space
  for silence, and engaging with diverging viewpoints are important.
- I suppose where I begin to question these ideas is in reality.
  Where in reality is it okay to begin engaging with folks who are
  openly racist, sexist, etc.? I'd prefer not to meet at some middle
  ground with these folks. Though, I understand that this dialoguing
  may be important for getting these folks to shift away from their
  viewpoints. That said, this gives me centrism vibes. 
- To me, a lot of this feels like fancy academic terminology and
  theory to say: **empathy**
- There was a heavy focus on note taking during a conversation
  which seems really unnatural. I would actually consider that
  distracting, possibly. Like, imagine if I took my phone out
  to take notes. That would get misconstrued as not listening. 
- I found the comments about breaking down barriers between
  participants and researchers to be on par with my own thinking
  about how qualitative research should work. Give up on trying
  to make it "objective." 
- I thought the authors had an interesting take on the idea of
  "I don't know." Typically, we spend a lot of time trying to
  get students to admit they don't know something, so to then
  treat that as cowardly is weird. 
- Also, just realized that the professor for this course
  wrote this particular chapter. I hope my takes weren't so
  harsh.
