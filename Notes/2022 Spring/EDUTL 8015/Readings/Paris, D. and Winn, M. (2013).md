## Chapter 2: The Space Between Listening and Storying

- Language matters!
- Listening matters!
  - A framework of listening means telling, retelling, and re-presenting 
    stories in nonlinear ways
- Questions
  - What does it mean to listen and engage listening as a framwork in literacy research?
  - In what ways do practices in listening converge with acts of storying/storytelling/
    authoring?
  - How might these acts and actions foster innovative processes for conducting
    critical research and PiH with young people?

### Vignettes in Stories and Storying

- Valerie and the author share a story about exchanging research ideas.
  This conversation leans into the idea of "listening"
- The author brings up the idea that research should be more than for
  a purpose of for people and rather **with** and **alongside** others.
- Ah, PiH has an explanation: Projects in Humanization
- Interactions are about depth

### A Theoretical Consideration: Listening and Projects in Humanization

- We need to listen to what young people are saying and think about why they are saying
  it.
- Listening is grounded in Bakhtin's "semiotic mediation"
- Three concepts: dialogiticality, utterance, and voice
- Dialogue is collaboritively constructed
