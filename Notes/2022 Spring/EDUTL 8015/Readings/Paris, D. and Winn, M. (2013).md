## Highlighted bits

- Language matters!
- Listening matters!
  - A framework of listening means telling, retelling, and re-presenting 
    stories in nonlinear ways
- Questions
  - What does it mean to listen and engage listening as a framwork in literacy research?
  - In what ways do practices in listening converge with acts of storying/storytelling/
    authoring?
  - How might these acts and actions foster innovative processes for conducting
    critical research and PiH with young people?

### Vignettes in Stories and Storying

- Valerie and the author share a story about exchanging research ideas.
  This conversation leans into the idea of "listening"
- The author brings up the idea that research should be more than for
  a purpose of for people and rather **with** and **alongside** others.
