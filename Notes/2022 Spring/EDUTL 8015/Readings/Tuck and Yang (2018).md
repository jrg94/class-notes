### Thoughts

- A little weirded out by the astrology match up with social justice
- Really appreciate all of the great metaphors (e.g., iPod)
- I can tell this book is written by anarchists. There are
  a lot of the usual shots taken at leftists generally. For example,
  there are conversations around the practicality of decolonization
  and abolition. I was never fully onboard with these ideas because
  I don't feel that anarchism is a sound system or set of beliefs.
  That said, the authors have a clear and understandable mistrust 
  of the state--especially with a focus on Black and Indigenous
  folks. 
- I am particularly interested in the prison abolition section of
  the book. I'm totally onboard with the abolition of the private
  prison system, and I believe any state run prisons should focus
  primarily on rehabilitation. That said, I'm interested to hear
  about the alternatives the author describes. Perhaps I'll be
  an anarchist after reading this book.
