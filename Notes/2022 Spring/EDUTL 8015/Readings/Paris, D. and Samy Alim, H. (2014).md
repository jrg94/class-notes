# What Are We Seeking to Sustain Through Culturally Sustaining  Pedagogy? A Loving Critique Forward

Paris, D., & Alim, H. S. (2014). What are we seeking to sustain through culturally sustaining pedagogy? A loving critique forward. Harvard educational review, 84(1), 85-100.

## Abstract

- Paris and Alim set up the paper for critical analysis
  of asset pedagogies through the lens of culturally
  sustaining pedagogies. 
- The focus is on pluralism: the idea that there are
  multiple identities in the classroom
- Not only are there multiple identities, but those
  identities are evolving and changing
- Youth culture can reproduce systemic inequalities!

## Introduction

## CSP in the Tradition of Asset Pedagogies

## Sustaining Heritage and Community Practices

## Further Inward: Critical Reflexivity

## Reflecting Forward on CSP

## Thoughts

- As usual, I'm a fan of work that isn't one-dimensional.
  In this article, the authors recognize that young people
  have a capacity for change but also a capacity to replicate
  existing structures.
