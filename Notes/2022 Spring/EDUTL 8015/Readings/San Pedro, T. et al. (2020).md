## Abstract

- Trialogic (not dialogic): interactions between students, teachers,
  and themselves.
- A ton of jargon: moments of tension, grappling, and awakening
- Yet more: incompleteness, citationality

## Background

- Mentions of knowledge deposits: instructors hold all knowledge
- 7014 is a graduate course with diverse backgrounds
- Dr. San Pedro goes by SP (interesting)
- Students were asked to think about pedagogy in classroom
  - Students reviewed their autoethnographies
- Background shares identities of participants and authors

## Methodology



## Thoughts

- I really need to include a citation of Freire into my teaching
  materials
- Yo, this background is sick! I want to steal every one of these
  citations to back up why I teach the way that I do. I get a bit
  of pushback for making my classes too "messy" due to the discussion
  style.
