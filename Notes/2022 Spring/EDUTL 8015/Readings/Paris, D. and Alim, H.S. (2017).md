# Culturally Sustaining Pedagogies

Paris, D., & Alim, H. S. (Eds.). (2017). Culturally sustaining 
    pedagogies: Teaching and learning for justice in a changing 
    world. Teachers College Press.

## Chapter 6: "This Stuff Interests Me"

- Culturally sustaining pedagogies (CSP)
- Student's cultures must be viewed as dynamic
- Sacred truth space
  - Safe spaces for whom?
  - Share our truths and hear multiple truths
  - Safety is not the goal

### Lessons Learned

- Culture is not static
- Identity varies based on context
- Trust == authentic selves
- **I don't understand this last bullet**

## Thoughts

- I felt like the idea of safe spaces not being inherently safe
  was great! We need more of this. 
- Having a rubric for discussion seems to go against this idea of
  feeling vulnerable.
