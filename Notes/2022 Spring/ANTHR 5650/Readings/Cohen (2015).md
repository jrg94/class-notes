Cohen, Eating Soup without a Spoon: Anthropological Theory and Method in 
    the Real World, University of Texas Press, 2015

## Introduction

Pages 1 - 18

- Lots of very descriptive writings about a house and 
  its location in Oaxaca, Mexico
- A brief description of field work is laced into the text
- "Mauro's Gringos" LMAO

### Writing About Fieldwork

- Two approaches to writing
  - Methodological tools
  - Experiences of the individual
- Ooh ethnography has many methods!
  - The use of focus groups is interesting
- "While anthropologists write about methods, they can lose sight
  of the challenges and vagaries of everyday life."
- Fieldwork is how we do anthropology
- Anthropologists know people lie and plan for it
- Trust and rapport grow and change through fieldwork
- "Anthropologists enter the field with a foundation in theory
  and methods, and a clear set of questions."
- Ethnography contains so much data that you could spend
  a lifetime analyzing it
- The focus of the work in this case was on showing the
  effects of globalization on rural mexico
- Drawing lines around competition
- Living in the village was like camping for a year

### Fieldwork

- There is no wrong way to do ethnography: subjective or objective
- Example
  - Use of a household survey to collect demographics
  - The survey above was built around themes observed
  - Also used interviews: some formal, some informal
  - Detailed observation
- Seven stages of fieldwork
  - Initial contact
  - Culture shock
  - Discovering the obvious
  - The break
  - Focusing
  - Exhaustion
  - Leaving
- Trust is needed to get details about lives
- Wearing many hats!
  - Learning to cook
  - Learning to farm
- Ethics: are our participants doing illegal things?
- **Ethnography does not fit positivism!**
- Reaching the point of **theoretical saturation**

### Thoughts

- Right now, I'm mainly thinking about whether or
  not ethnography is appropriate for the type of 
  research I want to conduct.
- I'm also thinking that ethnography sounds pretty
  awesome, and I'm not sure I'm qualified to do it. 
- I really enjoy this reading! I feel like I can
  see myself doing ethnography. I'm just not sure
  what it would look like yet. 

## Chapter 1: Setting Up and Settling In (pg 19)

- Good luck convincing future informants!
- IRB baby!
- No running water (weird thing to point out)

### Before the Field (pg 21)

- Some folks never make it to the field
- Other folks leave the field quickly
- Major preparations before heading to Mexico
  - Learning Spanish
  - Learning about Oaxaca

### Why Santa Ana (pg 23)

- Santa Ana is unknown for its textiles despite doing the same
  work as a nearby town, Teotitlan
- This fact allowed for the author to engage with the locals

### Arriving (pg 25)

- Lots of nervousness!
- Met Don Felipe and Pablo
- A ton of descriptions of the town
- Dogs that sounded fierce LOL
- Bouncing back and forth between Spanish and English
  - Interesting to think informants might want to practice English
