# Eating Soup without a Spoon: Anthropological Theory and Method in the Real World

Cohen, Eating Soup without a Spoon: Anthropological Theory and Method in 
    the Real World, University of Texas Press, 2015

## Introduction

Pages 1 - 18

- Lots of very descriptive writings about a house and 
  its location in Oaxaca, Mexico
- A brief description of field work is laced into the text
- "Mauro's Gringos" LMAO

### Writing About Fieldwork

- Two approaches to writing
  - Methodological tools
  - Experiences of the individual
- Ooh ethnography has many methods!
  - The use of focus groups is interesting
- "While anthropologists write about methods, they can lose sight
  of the challenges and vagaries of everyday life."
- Fieldwork is how we do anthropology
- Anthropologists know people lie and plan for it
- Trust and rapport grow and change through fieldwork
- "Anthropologists enter the field with a foundation in theory
  and methods, and a clear set of questions."
- Ethnography contains so much data that you could spend
  a lifetime analyzing it

### Thoughts

- Right now, I'm mainly thinking about whether or
  not ethnography is appropriate for the type of 
  research I want to conduct.
- I'm also thinking that ethnography sounds pretty
  awesome, and I'm not sure I'm qualified to do it.
