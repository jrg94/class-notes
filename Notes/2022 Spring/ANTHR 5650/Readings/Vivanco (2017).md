### Thoughts

- So far, this book is a relatively easy read. 
- I'm enjoying the way it's written: not too hard to follow

## Chapter 2: A Concise and Practical Overview of Fieldwork

- Anthropology follows three traditions
  - Culture
  - Holism
  - Relativism
- Qualitative Fieldwork
  - Humanism
  - Scientific Empiricism
  - Particularism + case study
  - Cross-cultural Perspective
  - Holism
  - Prolonged experiential immersion
  - Planned, yet eclectic
  - Methods as repertoire
  - Reflexivity
  - Collaboration and trust
- The goal of fieldwork
  - A trustworthy account of a group of people, a social
    process, an event, or an institution
- Fieldwork is inductive
- How do we trust fieldwork?
  - Is it credible?
  - Plausible?
  - Transferable?
  - Dependable?
  - Confirmable?
- **You can do fieldwork in WoW?!**
- Backyard anthropology
- Concerns
  - Analytical
  - Resources
  - Logisitics
  - Ethics
  - Personality
- Get reliable equipment

### Thoughts

- Now, this chapter was excellent. There was quite
  a bit of jargon that I was thankfully already
  familiar with as a qualitative researcher.
  That said, I quite liked this chapter as someone
  considering doing ethnography. I feel like this
  work is a good fit for me--especially considering
  the mention of backyard anthropology. I'm not
  exactly planning to work in unfamiliar territory.
- Reading this chapter got me thinking about how
  I might personally conduct ethnography. Things
  I'm thinking about is pulling students of to the
  side to discuss achievements with them to get
  a feel for their ideologies around success.  

## Chapter 3: Fieldwork Values and Ethics

- Gathering data is not a value-neutral activity
- Anthroplogy is distrusted due to colonialism
- Do no harm
- Be open and honest regarding your own work
- Rules are inflexible! (I love this)
- IRB is important

## Chapter 4: Taking Notes

- What do anthropologists do? They write!
- Note taking is an interpetive activity
  - We have to make decisions about what we think is important and what might not be
  - Therefore, notes are only a small representation of actual people's lives
- Field notes can be taken during or directly after an event (for memory's sake)
- Field notes are for the "future self"
- Key principles of note taking include
  - Jotting down background information
  - Describe instead of summarize
  - Do not generalize
  - Do not project emotions into the work
  - Jot down intuitions
  - Jot down questions that you have
- Always practice note taking
- Grow your descriptive vocabulary

### "Head Notes": Remembering, Elaborating, and Filling in from Memory

- A return to the scene where you incorporate things you remeber later

### Notes on Spoken and Nonverbal Communication

- Use as much of the actual phrasing as possible
- Don't forget to include body language, facial expressions, etc.

### Other Notes

- Sketches: vivid details of a scene
- Episodes: chronological events
- Tales: a combination of episodes and sketches
- Also, ethnographers collect documents as well

### Thoughts

- The more I read about anthropology, the more it reminds me of programming
- This idea of the future self is so prevalent in development

## Chapter 5: Observing

- Observing is more than people watching
- Go to a public place and take notes about what is happening there (homework 6)
- Engage the 5 senses
- Focus on areas of interest
- Pick a focus ahead of time
  - e.g., an activity, a place, a group, a phenomenon, etc.
- Use concrete language (e.g., gender, race, etc.) not general terms

### Combining Observation and Participatio

- The participatory approach becomes autoethnographic 
- "Step out to use the bathroom" (I love this)
- Head notes are important in this context

### Thoughts

- Observations became very weird to me in this chapter
- There are a lot of assumptions we have to make about the people
  we are observing.
- How do we note down a gender without making an assumption? Do we ask? Seems intrusive. 
- I understand the purpose, but this leans into some troubling territory!
- Surely, folks would understand if your description did not map to their identity.
- Lots to think about!
- The author notes that the line between observation and participation is murky.
  I would imagine so.
- When we were asked to note down a conversation we had with someone, I did
  it after the fact. I was worried this was a bad idea, but the author
  mentions that this is just a reconstruction of head notes. I'm feeling
  somewhat validated now. 

## Chapter 6: Listening

- "Listening is not just about being on the receiving end of sound"
- Listening is an active process
  - Concentrate
  - Be empathetic
  - Be patient
  - Focus on tone

### Acoustic Environments

- Relationships between places and the sounds in them matter
  - e.g., what does a library sound like? How about a classroom?

### Thoughts

- We trickled into boomer territory with the take on listening
- This chapter was extremely short. I would have loved to learn more about
  how to listen properly. As a musician, this is an important skill that
  I think was overlooked.

## Chapter 7: Asking Questions

- Be sensitive of context (i.e., what to ask when)
- Approaches to question asking:
  - Surveys
  - Interviews (formal, open-ended)
  - Conversations
  - Group interviews
- Surveys are limited:
  - You don't necessarily know what questions to ask
  - You don't know how to order those questions
- Ethnographers care more about open-ended interviews

### Asking Questions to Get People Talking

- Think about:
  - Be clear about intentions
  - Be prepared
  - Have a mental framework for questions
    - e.g., past-present-future framework
  - Think about good questions
  - Frame a good question
    - e.g., don't use yes or no questions
  - Use direct questions sparingly
    - Probe around the topic
  - Know how to keep going and when to stop

### Whom to Interview?

- Types of people:
  - Gatekeepers
  - Self-selected individuals
  - Reflective individuals
  - Knowledge keepers

### Thoughts

- Now this is a useful chapter! It will help me in my research.
