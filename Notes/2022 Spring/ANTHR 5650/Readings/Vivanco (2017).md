### Thoughts

- Now, this chapter was excellent. There was quite
  a bit of jargon that I was thankfully already
  familiar with as a qualitative researcher.
  That said, I quite liked this chapter as someone
  considering doing ethnography. I feel like this
  work is a good fit for me--especially considering
  the mention of backyard anthropology. I'm not
  exactly planning to work in unfamiliar territory.
- Reading this chapter got me thinking about how
  I might personally conduct ethnography. Things
  I'm thinking about is pulling students of to the
  side to discuss achievements with them to get
  a feel for their ideologies around success.
