### Thoughts

- Now, this chapter was excellent. There was quite
  a bit of jargon that I was thankfully already
  familiar with as a qualitative researcher.
  That said, I quite liked this chapter as someone
  considering doing ethnography. I feel like this
  work is a good fit for me--especially considering
  the mention of backyard anthropology. I'm not
  exactly planning to work in unfamiliar territory.
- Reading this chapter got me thinking about how
  I might personally conduct ethnography. Things
  I'm thinking about is pulling students of to the
  side to discuss achievements with them to get
  a feel for their ideologies around success.  

## Chapter 3: Fieldwork Values and Ethics

- Gathering data is not a value-neutral activity
- Anthroplogy is distrusted due to colonialism
- Do no harm
- Be open and honest regarding your own work
- Rules are inflexible! (I love this)
- IRB is important

## Chapter 4: Taking Notes

- What do anthropologists do? They write!
- Note taking is an interpetive activity
  - We have to make decisions about what we think is important and what might not be
  - Therefore, notes are only a small representation of actual people's lives
- Field notes can be taken during or directly after an event (for memory's sake)
- Field notes are for the "future self"
- Key principles of note taking include
  - Jotting down background information
  - Describe instead of summarize
  - Do not generalize
  - Do not project emotions into the work
  - Jot down intuitions
  - Jot down questions that you have
- Always practice note taking
- Grow your descriptive vocabulary

### "Head Notes": Remembering, Elaborating, and Filling in from Memory

- A return to the scene where you incorporate things you remeber later

### Notes on Spoken and Nonverbal Communication

- Use as much of the actual phrasing as possible
- Don't forget to include body language, facial expressions, etc.

### Other Notes

- Sketches: vivid details of a scene
- Episodes: chronological events
- Tales: a combination of episodes and sketches
- Also, ethnographers collect documents as well

### Thoughts

- The more I read about anthropology, the more it reminds me of programming
- This idea of the future self is so prevalent in development

## Chapter 5: Observing
