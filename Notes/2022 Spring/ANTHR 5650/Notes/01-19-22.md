# Research Design

- Need to be prepared to do ethnography
- Found skeletons of ancestors!?
- What is the research design?
  - I'm going to be flexible and adaptive
- Data analysis needs to happen while you collect data
- Don't go native!
  - Cultural appropriation
  - You will not become a member of that community
- Write letters to your anthropological ancestors (LMAO)
  - Great way to start data analysis
- We are not in the business of having an adventure
  - We discover the obvious!
  - If some bad happens, I could leave!
- Zapotec? Do you need to know it to work in Oaxaca?
  - No! You can survive on Spanish. 
  - Unless there are monolingual folks...
  - Playing foreign language telephone (the game)
- You can only be so prepared
  - But the things you know can help you from failing
